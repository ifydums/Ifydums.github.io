## About

I am a data professional with a strong academic foundation in Mathematics and Geographic Information Systems, and practical experience analyzing complex datasets to support business decision-making across finance, research, and technology environments.

I am currently transitioning into Cloud Engineering, building hands-on expertise in cloud infrastructure, automation, and scalable system design. My focus is on developing secure, reliable, and performance-driven cloud solutions.

Through continuous learning and practical implementation — including structured training with Tech Expert Academy — I am deepening my technical capabilities and positioning myself to contribute effectively in modern cloud-driven environments.

This portfolio showcases my projects, technical growth, and commitment to engineering excellence.
